		<p>
			<br>[Verse 1: KB]</br>
<br>Yeah, K to the second letter</br>
<br>How you want to do it homie?</br>
<br>I'm all up in it, down to the bone I feel it</br>
<br>Coming and breaking it down with that wiggity wiggity style</br>
<br>Man we really be living it out on mission</br>
<br>Flow God, no lie, oh yeah</br>
<br>We bust rhymes, one ride, no stops</br>
<br>Take 'em to show dog, see the most high, so high</br>
<br>Leave 'em so shocked frozen face like botox</br>
<br>Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no stars up in this tour</br>
<br>See, the stars that my dogs love to applaud</br>
<br>Are the faithful saints that endure</br>
<br>You could never stop em'</br>
<br>You got a better chance winning the Tour de France</br>
<br>With no legs against Lance</br>
<br>Or seeing Mr. Edward Scissorhands</br>
<br>On Instagram taking a selfie</br>
<br>Your hell freeze before I'm ashamed off in my LP</br>
<br>[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]</br>
<br>All them really wanna come see</br>
<br>This beat 1-3-1-3</br>
<br>Get ape when I speak</br>
<br>I'mma say my piece</br>
<br>Throw the peace sign with some boatload of truth if you can’t see</br>
<br>Yeah buddy, rollin' so deep it ain't funny</br>
<br>My beliefs on the back of that money</br>
<br>And I promise I ain't frontin'</br>
<br>I’m just tryna jump up on the track and let 'em know I run it</br>
<br>Yeah buddy, uptown be the place I put on for</br>
<br>Faith got me living risky like I’m going for it on 4th & 11</br>
<br>I ain't talking bout' them Concords, do you want more?</br>
<br>Blake in the paint I'mma bang for the cause</br>
<br>Unashamed be the lifestyle more then them tours</br>
<br>Oh Lord he coming back like an encore</br>
